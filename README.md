# Health and Longevity Knowledge Base

This project is a simple web-based application that presents a comprehensive, hierarchical overview of topics related to health and longevity. The information is displayed in an interactive, collapsible accordion format, allowing users to explore the various subjects and their relationships.

## Usage

To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The main page displays the health and longevity topics in a nested accordion.

-   **Expand/Collapse:** Click on any topic to expand or collapse its sub-topics.
-   **View Topic Details:** Click on the title of a topic to navigate to a dedicated page for that topic. (Note: Currently, these pages contain placeholder content).
-   **External Search:** If a topic does not have a dedicated page, clicking on it will open a DuckDuckGo search for that topic in a new tab.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of the following files:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the accordion view.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that dynamically builds the accordion from `data.json`.
-   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the application.
-   `data.json`: The JSON file containing the hierarchical data for the accordion. This file is generated by `parse_outline.py`.
-   `LFHoutline.txt`: The source text file for the content. The hierarchy is defined by indentation.
-   `parse_outline.py`: A Python script that parses `LFHoutline.txt` and generates `data.json`.
-   `topic.html`: The HTML template for individual topic pages.
-   `topic.js`: The JavaScript file that populates the topic pages with content.
-   `content-manifest.json`: A list of topics that have dedicated content pages.

## Updating the Content

The content of the accordion is sourced from the `LFHoutline.txt` file. To add, remove, or modify topics, follow these steps:

1.  **Edit the outline:** Open `LFHoutline.txt` and make your desired changes. The hierarchy is determined by indentation, with each level of indentation representing a deeper level in the accordion.
2.  **Regenerate the data file:** Run the `parse_outline.py` script to update the `data.json` file.

    ```bash
    python parse_outline.py
    ```

This will update the data that is displayed on the website.

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   **Data Processing:** Python

## Note on AI Generation
